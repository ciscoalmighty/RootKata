In this project an input file is read line by line and saved as a list of strings. I used this collection of lines and methods in the Driver and Trip classes to determine the driver's name, and the trip's distance and miles per hour. I used Organize to make my information about drivers and trips orderly. I created a dictionary with the driver's name as the key, and a list of doubles (the distance traveled and the miles per hour) as the value. When a driver has taken more than one trip, I added the distance traveled together to make total distance traveled, as well as make a new average speed based on the new and old miles per hour. I then arrange the dictionary in order from longest distance traveled to shortest. Finally I wrote out the information to a report that will show the driver's name, the total distance, and the average speed of all their trips.

I realize that some of these methods could have more strict access modifiers and could be done as ternary operations instead are so simple that testing is effectively redundant, However, I wanted to show my ability to organize and follow TDD thoroughly. This might have resulted in a more verbose style of coding than would typically represent my work, but I hope the thought behind this choice is evident and appropriate for an interview level problem.
